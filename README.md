# Education Program Evaluation-Children with Disabilities (2021)
This project evaluates an education program targeting children with disabilities using real-world data. It demonstrates how to assess program outcomes, identify gaps in access, and propose actionable improvements using Julius AI and Excel

# üîç Problem Statement

Children with disabilities often face barriers to education, including inadequate access, limited resources, and insufficient program evaluation. Without proper analysis:
- Are these programs truly increasing access to education?
- Which regions or demographics are underserved?
- Where should policymakers focus efforts for maximum impact?

This project aims to answer these questions by analyzing enrollment, participation, and support service data.
